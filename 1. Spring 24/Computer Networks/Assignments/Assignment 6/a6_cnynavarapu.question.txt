CS542 Spring 2024, Assignment 6
For this assignment use the accompanying Jupyter notebook on FABRIC.

Question 1: (1 mark)
Use Caper to expand this pcap expression:
tcp[0:2] = tcp[4:2] && tcp src port 1111 && tcp[8:4] = 0

Question 2: (1 mark)
Use Caper to compile this pcap expression into BPF (unoptimized):
icmp6 && (ip6[40] == 1 || ip6[40] == 2)

Question 3: (3 mark)
Work out the pcap expression that matches the following BPF code. Once you have formed a pcap expression, expand it using Caper, and write that down as your answer.
l000: ldh [12]
l001: jeq #0x800 , l002 , l010
l002: ldb [23]
l003: jeq #0x11 , l004 , l010
l004: ldh [20]
l005: jset #0x1fff , l010 , l006
l006: ldxb 4 * ([14] & 0xf)
l007: ldh [x + 16]
l008: jeq #0x1e81 , l009 , l010
l009: ret #262144
l010: ret #0

(Extra credit) Question 4: (2.5 marks)
Write a Scapy program that generates a .pcap file containing 5 distinct packets, each of which are ACCEPTED by the filter in Question 3.
You can check the pcap file by using the 'filter' program in your notebook, and confirming that the pcap file is processed as expected.

(Extra credit) Question 5: (2.5 marks)
Write a Scapy program that generates a .pcap file containing 5 distinct packets, each of which are NOT ACCEPTED by the filter in Question 3.
You can check the pcap file by using the 'filter' program in your notebook, and confirming that the pcap file is processed as expected.
